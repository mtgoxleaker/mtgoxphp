mtgoxphp
========

This project is for commenting and understanding the php source code for Mt. Gox which was leaked in March 2014.

In particular, in conjunction with the project at http://www.reddit.com/r/mtgoxaddresses, we are interested in what the expected flows of bitcoin on the blockchain should be, once the bitcoin are transferred to Mt. Gox.

People with an understanding of PHP are invited to add comments to the source code, as well as additional documents to this repository. An overview of bitcoin flows produced by this code as the exchange was running would be very useful.
